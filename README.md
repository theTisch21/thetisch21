### Hello there

I like programming, and I hate programming. I want to switch to Linux, but all my video games and school stuff only run on Windows or Mac.

Current projects:
- [theTisch21/Auto-MC-Config](https://github.com/theTisch21/Auto-MC-Config)
- [theTisch21/Backup-System-3](https://github.com/theTisch21/Backup-System-3)

Past projects:
- [theTisch21/discord-funding-bot](https://github.com/theTisch21/discord-funding-bot)

I'm also a part of First Robotics Competition, on team [1294 TopGun](https://github.com/FRC-1294)
